# PROJECT MEMORY

## Purpose

Durable project facts only. Do not use this as a transcript.

## Product

LIKHA-SIS 0.2 is a native-first, local-first, offline-capable SIS for Philippine DepEd schools.

Primary targets:

- Windows desktop
- Android mobile

Shared stack:

- React
- TypeScript
- Tauri 2

## Locked Principles

- Privacy/security is highest priority.
- Synthetic data only in development, testing, screenshots, fixtures, demos, and AI-assisted work.
- SQLite is the device working database.
- Offline writes persist locally immediately.
- Synchronization is a separate subsystem.
- Provider-specific infrastructure stays behind interfaces/adapters.
- UI/domain must not depend directly on cloud providers.
- Zero-billing-oriented; no paid services without explicit approval.
- Comfortable is the default teacher interface mode.
- Efficient / Comfortable / Guided retain functional parity.

## Architecture

UI → Application Services → Domain → Repository Ports → Infrastructure/Platform Adapters → SyncProvider → Cloud
